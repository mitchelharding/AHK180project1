          <h2>Monthly Subscription Model:</h2>
          <p id="index31"> Based on the Excel sheet provided to me; South Lands and Lone Tree have approximately 1500 active members to date. Of that 1500 members approximately + - 600 pay a monthly subsrcription fee of around $29.99. Bringing the total monthly income to just over $18 000. Assuming 10% of the month-to-month members (just 60 members) agree to a "Vitrual Trainer add on" subscription fee of $19.99: This would generate a little under $15 000 of revenue on top of month-to-month membership fees per year. This does not include the 800 + members that pay their membership up front.</p>

          <h2>Delivery Mechanism</h2>
          <p id="index32"> I would assume responsibility of the management of these online clients. We would need to create a short form on the lone Tree and SouthLands Website which the client could then full out. This form would include questions regarding their exercise history, physical and dietary limitations and any further info that could aid in the efficacy of their personalised "Virtual Training Program." (examples of this type of form provided in proposal).

            <br><br> Once I have the client specifications in place I can then tailor my fitness manual to suit their needs and abilities.</p>
