          <h2>Maximize rate of return:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monthly Subscription Model:</strong>An automatic monthlty payment of the amount agreed upon between the TruFit and I (Shelby Bishop). The price should be affordable but substantial to create a healthy rate of returb for TruFit and cover the cost of the (Virtual) trainers time and attention. Precentage splits can be decided at a further date.</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Mechanism:</strong> How the client receives the Training manual and Nutrtition guide depends on TruFits ability to structure the online delivery mechanism. TruFit should prepare a form for potential clients to fill out online as training/nutrition prescriptions will change from client to client.</li>
            <li><strong>The Training/Nutritional design:</strong> Both of these will be designed by me (Shelby Brook Bishop). The nature of their structure will be portrayed further on in this proposal.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It should be noted that this Virtual Training program could potentially serve as gateway to hiring in-house trainer for those that are unsure of the process. But primarily it will should serve a secondary option for those that cannot necessarily afford an TruFit in-house trainer. </p>
